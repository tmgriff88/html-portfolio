<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey folks! I'm an author who has published a few short stories and is finishing up a novel series. 
  We just had a lovely baby girl, Robin, and are happily enjoying our time with her while working on our passions.
  Stop by whenever you like for biweekly blog posts on anything that catches my interest, published works and
  videos on my youtube channel!</p>

<h2>What you can expect on my youtube channel</h2>
<p>Readings of published short stories will be uploaded as those stories are published. There are also weekly
   gaming highlight videos or illustrated (again by me!) synopses of various book titles. Most are fiction or sci fi winners
   of some of the best-known literary awards, but I also throw in some classics and nonfiction pieces I've been reading.

<h3>Hobbies outside of writing</h3>
<p>As you can see, while my focus is writing, I have a wide range of interests I'm happy to share! In addition to gaming,
   reading some of the most acclaimed books in my genre (among other genres), and art, I also did all the web development for this
   website. So please do contact me if you notice anything not working (or would like to suggest new features), or even if you're
   interested in a commission. And of course, I welcome any questions about my writing!
