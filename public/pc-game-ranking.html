<h3>Hades</h3>
<p>Everything so polished and solid with a story adapted perfectly for the gameplay loop. 10/10</p>

<h3>Baldur's Gate 3</h3>
<p>Not my personal cup of tea, but an ambitious project that largely met all its production goals and did an excellent job at bringing D&D tabletop gameplay into PC gaming. 9/10</p>

<h3>Beacon Pines</h3>
<p>Adorable story lovingly executed to mimic old-school choose your own adventure stories. 7/10</p>

<h3>The Medium</h3>
<p>Not as polished as some of the others, but a great addition to the horror stealth genre with some interesting puzzles to solve. 6/10</p>
